# Cozy Garden Simulator

Cozy Garden Simulator is a web-based game where players cultivate a magical garden, growing various plants with unique characteristics and reacting to dynamic magic conditions. The game combines strategy, simulation, and a touch of magic to create a relaxing yet engaging experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Plant Growth:** Plants progress through different growth stages at varying speeds, influenced by both environmental factors and magical conditions.
- **Magic Conditions:** The garden's magical environment changes periodically, affecting plant growth and health in unique ways.
- **Plant Breeding:** Players can breed plants to produce offspring with unique traits, adding depth to the gameplay.
- **Environmental Challenges:** Weather, soil quality, and pests can affect plant growth, challenging players to adapt their strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state changes in a reactive way.
- **Redux**: Used for state management across the application, facilitating actions like plant growth, magic conditions, and more.
- **nanoid**: Generates unique IDs for each plant to manage them effectively within the Redux store.
